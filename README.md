# dip-2024-2

# Objective

To enable students to understand and apply digital image processing techniques for analyzing and manipulating digital images. Students will develop practical skills in image processing algorithms, pixel manipulation, geometric transformations, spatial and frequency domain filtering, as well as learning how to implement these techniques using Python and OpenCV.

# Syllabus

1. **Introduction to Digital Image Processing**: Basic concepts, applications, and image processing pipeline.
1. **Image Formation and Representation**: Digital image structure, resolution, pixel depth, color space, and color models.
1. **Intensity Transformations**: Logarithmic transformations, gamma correction, histogram equalization.
1. **Arithmetic and Logical Operations with Images**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, AND, OR, NOT, and XOR on images.
1. **Geometric Transformations**: Translation, rotation, scaling, and interpolation.
1. **Spatial Filtering**: Mean filters, median filters, Sobel, Laplacian, and custom filters.
1. **Frequency Domain Filtering**: Fourier Transform, low-pass and high-pass filters in the frequency domain.
1. **Edge Detection and Image Segmentation**: Edge detection techniques and segmentation methods.
1. **Mathematical Morphology**: Dilation, erosion, opening, and closing on binary and grayscale images.
1. **Advanced Applications and Practical Projects**: Implementation of algorithms in Python using OpenCV.
